# Functional Journey
This repo will be a conglomerate of notebooks and code samples in various languages as I try to learn more about functional concepts.    

The language I am most comfortable with and have the deepest knowledge of is C# - so it seems like a natual place to start.  Believe it or not, C# is actually a functional langauge and becoming more and more functional with each version.  My hope in starting with C# is that I will be able to focus on the functional paradigm without also learning a completely new syntax and environment.
